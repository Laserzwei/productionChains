# Production chains mod

Extends the vanilla production chains to allow production of all available goods.

It comes in two versions:

1 extraminesM:
Adds a Diamond Mine and a Plant -> Bio Gas Fermenter.

2 extraminesS:
Adds a Coal + Energy -> Diamond Factory and a Plant -> Bio Gas Fermenter.


## Installation
Copy files into their respective /Avorion/ folders.

Selecting a version:

In /Avorion/data/scripts/lib/productionsindex.lua at the very bottom uncomment the version you want. "extraminesS" is active by default. (Only 1 version may be used at the same time!)
